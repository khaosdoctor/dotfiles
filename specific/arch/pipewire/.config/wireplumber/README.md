# Why this is here?

Sometimes, some programs will automatically adjust the microphone volume levels,
this is very annoying. So, this config along with the one in the `pipewire`
folder allow for disabling this behaviour in certain apps.

To add new apps just copy the lines and add the name of the app executable
(which you can get from `htop`) or the name of the client you get when running
`wpctl status`.
